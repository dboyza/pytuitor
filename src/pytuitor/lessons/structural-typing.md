# Program to a small protocol

Python often works best when a function asks an object to perform an operation rather than checking its concrete class.
This is **duck typing**: the object's supported operations matter more than its class name.
A `typing.Protocol` lists the attributes and methods an object should provide for static type checking.
An object can satisfy that protocol without inheriting from it.

```python
from typing import Protocol


class Named(Protocol):
    name: str


def title(item: Named) -> str:
    return item.name.upper()
```

`class Named(Protocol)` declares a protocol; annotated members describe its contract.
For a method declaration, a body of `...` is an ellipsis placeholder.
Annotations do not enforce the protocol at runtime.
`@runtime_checkable` enables limited runtime attribute checks, but it does not validate full type signatures and is unnecessary here.

`io.StringIO` is an in-memory text stream useful for testing.
Its `write(text)` method adds text, and `getvalue()` returns all accumulated text.
Other writers may return `None` from `write`; avoid depending on that return value.

## A read may be only one chunk

A stream-like object may return part of its data on each `read()` call.
Keep reading until it returns an empty string; whitespace inside a nonempty chunk is still data.
A protocol should require only the arguments the consumer actually passes.
If the consumer calls `read()` without a size, an unrelated implementation with just that signature is sufficient.
The consumer does not own a supplied resource unless its contract explicitly says it must close it.
