# Curriculum map

The release candidate has 75 lessons and 21 cumulative Lantern Reach milestones across 21 chapters.
The first three sections form the recommended sequence; Python depth and Specialized topics are optional.
Start learning begins with Foundations, and learners can open any chapter directly.
Each chapter lists useful preparation without locking access.
Lessons use blank Build followed by Repair.
Each chapter ends with Extend and independent Repair for the growing [Lantern Reach game](lantern-reach.md).
Use the [topic index](coverage.md) to find lessons by Python subject.

Optional mixed review adds one three-task session per chapter without changing required completion.
See [returning, checking, and reviewing](learning-experience.md) for resume behavior, feedback controls, and local review scheduling.

## Teaching and validation

Every chapter ends with a cumulative game milestone, scaled to the chapter's scope.
Generator and class context managers follow generators, decorators, and classes.
Packaging does not require async, and language machinery does not require packaging.

Each lesson states the names, inputs, outputs, and edge cases needed to build its program from a blank editor.
Game milestones specify the behavior to add and preserve when extending an earlier version.
Repair has its own behavior contract and a deliberately defective implementation, with a distinct scenario or debugging decision.
Checks report expected and actual behavior; reference solutions never replace learner drafts.
Stable lesson IDs preserve saved drafts and historical completion across curriculum updates.
A changed stage contract increases its revision and requires fresh checks.
Drafts from the retired standalone projects stay in the profile file but no longer appear in the course.

See the [authoring guide](authoring.md) and [challenge criteria](teaching-criteria.md) for terminology, prerequisite, and exercise standards.
Automated checks establish executable consistency.
Use the [learner study](learner-study.md) to assess teaching effectiveness with real learners.
